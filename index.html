    <h1>Joe Hazell</h1>
    <p>I am a focused Computer Science graduate with strong problem-solving skills, a willingness to learn new
        techniques and
        a keen interest in software engineering. I am experienced with a range of different programming languages and
        tools,
        and have work experience in the IT sector. In my spare time I like to work on personal programming projects,
        some of which are on my GitHub.</p>
